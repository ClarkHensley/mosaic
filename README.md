# MOSAIC

Mosaic is an in*development social media protocol with a focus on true freedom and decentralization

### Manifesto:
The internet and social media are among the greatest tools that Humans have made for sharing information and learning more about one another
It is a pity how the digital commons, which should be an ideal protocol for freedom of expression, has been commodified and turned into a marketing platform
The advent of the so*called Web 3.0 is the latest slight against the freedom of privacy of the users of the internet

### Goals:
##### Political Goals:
    * Software should be Free, Libre, and Open Source. Mosaic is licensed fully under GNU AGPL3
    * Social Media should be implemented as a protocol, not a platform. There will be no singular centralized instance of Mosaic
        * Mosaic can be federated by anyone who wishes to host an instance
        * Mosaic can also have self-hosted profiles which can then be associated with various external federations

##### Design Goals:
    * The vision for Mosaic is a modern take on the ideas of IRC, RSS, and the Blog, or, if you prefer, a FOSS take on Discord and Twitter
        * Part of the goal: an individualized profile, where you can post to a blog, or wall-like place, sharing your own documents, files, ideas, music, videos, or whatever else
            * Personal pages will be fully themable with custom CSS
        * The other main goal: IRC or Discord like chats, both individual direct messages and multi-person servers with different channels
            * Again, these servers will be fully themable, implement plugins, etc
    * There will be no "Algorithm." The protocol will not be built to promote any user's content above another's in any way. You will see posts in chronological order, and that will always be the default
    * There will be no advertising
    * There will be no harvesting of user data. Privacy is paramount to freedom on the internet, and data will never be collected, telemetry will never be sent
    * User choice is paramount to design, but so is ethics. Infinite Scroll will be an option, but will be turned off by default. Mosaic does not have a need to keep the user scrolling in order to sell advertisements. You should only use Mosaic for as long as you desire

### Why Mosaic?
    * In short, as Twitter seems to begin its slow death in late 2022 under Elon's weight, I wanted something else. I take much inspiration from [Mastadon](https://www.joinmastadon.org), a project for which I have much respect, but it's not quite what I want.
    * At the same time, while I spend dozens of hours a week on Discord, I have concerns about its corporate and centralized nature
    * Mosaic is my attempt to write what I want out of a protocol for chatting and posting that reflects my desires
